Virtual Mouse with Hand Tracking

This project implements a Virtual Mouse using OpenCV, Mediapipe, and Autopy, allowing users to control the mouse cursor and perform clicks using hand gestures. It utilizes real-time hand tracking to detect finger positions and translate them into mouse movements and actions.

Features
	•	Real-Time Hand Tracking:
	•	Detect hands and landmarks using Mediapipe.
	•	Identify specific fingers and their states (up or down).
	•	Mouse Control:
	•	Move the mouse cursor by moving your index finger.
	•	Perform a mouse click when both the index and middle fingers are close together.
	•	Smooth and Accurate Movements:
	•	The mouse cursor movement is smoothed for better control.
